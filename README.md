You’re absolutely right—10 ECTS (typically around 250-300 hours of work total, or 60-75 hours per person for a group of 4 over a semester) suggests a project that should be challenging but manageable within the time constraints. The previous proposal, while comprehensive, might indeed be overly ambitious for a semester project with a small team. Let’s scale it down to focus on core functionality, simplify the scope, and ensure it’s achievable while still meeting the minimum requirements (4 microservices, frontend, Kubernetes, C# backend, Python fraud detection, RabbitMQ, and logging). Below is a revised, lightweight version of the banking application tailored to your constraints.

## Revised Architecture Overview

The application will still use a microservices architecture with exactly four backend microservices (no optional extras), a simple frontend, and a streamlined feature set. It will run on Kubernetes, use RabbitMQ for messaging, and keep complexity low by reducing dependencies and advanced features like third-party integrations or serverless functions.

- **Team分工 (Tentative)**: 
  - Person 1: User Service + Frontend
  - Person 2: Account Service
  - Person 3: Transaction Service
  - Person 4: Fraud Detection Service + DevOps (Kubernetes, CI/CD)

- **Time Estimate**: ~60-75 hours per person, spread over a semester (e.g., 5-6 hours/week for 12-14 weeks).

## Microservices (Simplified)

1. **User Service**
   - **Language**: C# (ASP.NET Core)
   - **Functionality**: Handles user registration and login with basic username/password authentication (no JWT or OAuth2 to save time).
   - **Communication**: REST API for frontend; publishes registration events to RabbitMQ.
   - **Database**: SQLite (lightweight, embedded, no separate server setup).

2. **Account Service**
   - **Language**: C# (ASP.NET Core)
   - **Functionality**: Manages user accounts and balances (create account, view balance).
   - **Communication**: GraphQL API for frontend; listens to RabbitMQ for transaction updates.
   - **Database**: SQLite.

3. **Transaction Service**
   - **Language**: C# (ASP.NET Core)
   - **Functionality**: Processes simple transfers between accounts (no deposits/withdrawals to reduce scope).
   - **Communication**: REST API for frontend; uses RabbitMQ to coordinate with Fraud Detection and Account Services.
   - **Database**: SQLite.

4. **Fraud Detection Service**
   - **Language**: Python (Flask)
   - **Functionality**: Checks transfers for fraud using a basic rule (e.g., flag transfers > $1000). Logs results to a file.
   - **Communication**: Consumes and publishes messages via RabbitMQ.
   - **Database**: None (logs to a file instead of a database).

---

## Frontend (Simplified)

- **Technology**: React
- **Functionality**: 
  - Register/login via User Service (REST).
  - View account balance via Account Service (GraphQL).
  - Initiate a transfer via Transaction Service (REST).
  - Display transfer status (success or flagged as fraud).
- **Scope**: Minimal UI—just a few pages with basic forms and tables, no fancy styling or real-time updates.

---

## Infrastructure (Simplified)

- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ
  - Used for basic async communication (e.g., Transaction → Fraud Detection → Account).
  - Simple queues with no advanced features like retries or dead-letter queues.
- **Database**: SQLite
  - Embedded in each C# service to avoid managing a separate database server.
- **Containerization**: Docker
  - Basic Dockerfiles for each microservice and frontend.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
  - Run locally with Minikube or a simple cloud provider (e.g., DigitalOcean Kubernetes with a free tier).
  - Minimal setup: deployments and services, no ingress or advanced networking.
- **Logging**: 
  - File-based logging per service (e.g., text files in Python for fraud detection).
  - Skip ELK Stack to reduce setup time.
- **Monitoring**: None (optional Prometheus if time permits, but not prioritized).
- **CI/CD**: 
  - GitHub Actions with a simple pipeline: build Docker images, run basic tests, and deploy to Kubernetes.

## Specifications

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Management**:
   - Register with username/password.
   - Log in to access the app.
2. **Account Management**:
   - Create a single account per user with an initial balance.
   - View account balance.
3. **Transaction Processing**:
   - Transfer money between accounts.
   - Display transfer status (success or flagged).
4. **Fraud Detection**:
   - Flag transfers exceeding $1000 and log the decision.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Basic microservices structure (no high-load optimization needed).
- **Security**: Minimal—plain text passwords in SQLite (not production-ready, but fine for a demo).
- **Reliability**: Basic error handling; no complex retry logic.
- **Performance**: Adequate for a demo with a few users.
- **Maintainability**: Simple code with comments.
- **Deployability**: Deployable to Kubernetes via CI/CD.

## Communication Flow (Simplified Transfer)

1. **Frontend**: User submits a transfer via Transaction Service REST API.
2. **Transaction Service**: 
   - Publishes a “CheckFraud” message to RabbitMQ.
3. **Fraud Detection Service**: 
   - Consumes the message, checks if amount > $1000, logs result to a file, publishes “FraudResult”.
4. **Transaction Service**: 
   - Consumes “FraudResult”. If not fraudulent, publishes “UpdateAccounts”.
5. **Account Service**: 
   - Consumes “UpdateAccounts”, adjusts balances, publishes “TransferComplete”.
6. **Transaction Service**: 
   - Consumes “TransferComplete”, updates the transaction status.
7. **Frontend**: Polls Transaction Service to show the result.

## Development and Deployment Plan

1. **Project Management**:
   - Use GitHub with a monorepo (one repo, folders for each service).
   - Simple task board (GitHub Issues) for tracking.
2. **CI/CD Setup**:
   - GitHub Actions: 
     - Build Docker images.
     - Run minimal unit tests (e.g., one test per service).
     - Deploy to Minikube or a small Kubernetes cluster.
3. **Implementation Steps** (~60-75 hours total per person):
   - **Week 1-2**: Define specs, set up repo, and Docker/Kubernetes basics (10-15 hours).
   - **Week 3-5**: Build User Service + Frontend login/register (15-20 hours).
   - **Week 6-8**: Build Account Service + balance view (15-20 hours).
   - **Week 9-11**: Build Transaction Service + transfer logic (15-20 hours).
   - **Week 12-13**: Build Fraud Detection Service + RabbitMQ integration (10-15 hours).
   - **Week 14**: Polish UI, test, and deploy (5-10 hours).
4. **Deployment**:
   - Use Minikube locally for development.
   - Optionally deploy to a free/low-cost Kubernetes cluster (e.g., DigitalOcean) for the final demo.

## Why This Works for 10 ECTS

- **Reduced Scope**: Only core banking features (no email service, admin GUI, or third-party logins).
- **Simplified Tech**: SQLite instead of PostgreSQL, file logging instead of ELK, no monitoring unless time allows.
- **Minimal Frontend**: Basic React app with a few screens.
- **Team Size Fit**: Each person owns one microservice (or frontend), with one handling DevOps—workload is balanced.
- **Time Feasible**: ~60-75 hours per person aligns with 10 ECTS, assuming a semester of 12-14 weeks.

This version still meets all requirements (4 microservices, C# backend, Python fraud detection, RabbitMQ, Kubernetes, REST + GraphQL, logging for fraud), but it’s stripped down to be achievable by a group of 4 in a semester. Let me know if you’d like to tweak it further!
